# Classifying biomechanical attributes using KNN
The dataset is available at : http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/vertebral+column

Description : Each patient in the data set is represented by six biomechanical attributes derived from the shape and orientation of the pelvis and lumbar spine: pelvic incidence, pelvic tilt, lumbar lordosis angle, sacral slope, pelvic radius and grade of spondylolisthesis. 

The following convention is used for the class labels: DH (Disk Hernia), Spondylolisthesis (SL), Normal (NO) and Abnormal (AB).

Here in this project, we work on:
1. Preprocessing and exploratory data analysis.
2. Classification using K-Nearest Neighbour.
